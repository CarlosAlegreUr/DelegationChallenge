Assignment Title: Smart Contract Development for NFT Delegation System

## Introduction:
As a growing engineering team focused on blockchain technology, we are looking for a skilled engineer who can contribute to our innovative projects. This assignment is designed to assess your technical skills in Smart Contract development and your ability to innovate within the blockchain space.

## Objective:
Your task is to design and implement a Smart Contract system that enables a unique functionality within the NFT ecosystem. Specifically, we are interested in a system that allows an NFT owner to delegate their NFTs to another wallet without transferring ownership. This system should cater to ERC721 tokens, with potential scope for ERC20 tokens and other blockchain assets.

## Core Requirements:

- NFT Delegation Mechanism:

Develop a Smart Contract that allows a wallet to delegate an NFT to another wallet, enabling the delegatee to utilize the NFT's benefits without transferring ownership.
- Functionality and Security:

Ensure the delegation process is secure and does not compromise the safety of the NFT.
Incorporate mechanisms to revoke the delegation when needed.
- Extension and Scalability:

Consider how your solution can be extended to other types of tokens or assets.
Focus on making the system scalable and efficient.
- Testing and Documentation:

Thoroughly test your Smart Contracts.
Provide clear documentation on how to deploy and interact with your contracts.
## Deliverables:

1. A set of Smart Contracts that implement the NFT delegation functionality.
2. A detailed README file explaining your design choices, how to set up, deploy, and interact with your contracts.
3. Comprehensive test scripts demonstrating the functionality and security of your contracts.
